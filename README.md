## Android APK installation instructions

When installing a so-called unsigned apk on an Android device, the phone will usually prevent the installation because the apk doesn't come from the Google Play Store. This is a security measure to reduce the amount of malware installed on Android phones. But during development it's often easier to just share an apk file instead of using the Google Play Store or another tool to distribute a test version.

To bypass this behaviour one needs to enable **install from unkonwn sources** in the settings. Based on the Android version and the manufacturer this can be different from phone to phone.

The publication Android Authority provided a helpful guide on how to do this on different Android versions: https://www.androidauthority.com/how-to-install-apks-31494/
